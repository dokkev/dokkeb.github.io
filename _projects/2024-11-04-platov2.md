This is a collaborative project between [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) and [Sony Group Corporation](https://www.sony.net/). 

## Introduction 
The Sony PLATO project at UT Austin focuses on developing remote telemanipulation interfaces and framkeworks to grasp and manipulate tools in the human enviroments. Using the [Maestro Hand Exokeleton](https://reneu.robotics.utexas.edu/maestro-hand-exoskeleton-0), we can estimate the joint angles of the human hand provide force feedback via bowden cables and series elastic actuators. We developed a 3 fingered robotic hand HT2205 motors, ESP32 microcontroller, SimpleFOC Mini, and CAN bus based on our [SocketCAN Motor Control](/motorcan/).

Due to time limit, we didn't implement PCB board, so we used wires to connect all electrical components. Detail design of the PLATO Hand will be posted in the future. We adopted collocated direct driven motor to achieve proximal actuation with high force transprancey and high bandwidth control. While MCP joints (A/A and F/E) are direct driven, PIP joint (F/E) includes a cable transmission with 1:1 ratio. One of the unique feature of the hand is that fingertip matierals are made of soft resin while the fingernail made of hard resin is connected to 6-dof miniature force-torque sensors.

The low-level hardware interface for the PLATO Hand was implemented using [`ros2_control`](https://control.ros.org/iron/index.html) which allows seamless integration of the hardware to ROS 2 framework.

  Teleoperation of PLATO Hand with Maestro Hand Exoskeleton
</div>

We made a first prototype of the PLATO hand with [Roboligent](https://roboligent.com/). Then we teleoperated the PLATO hand and Optimo arm with the Maestro Hand Exoskeleton and 3D SpaceMouse. As a conclusion, we verified our teleoperation pipeline, we found several problems to address:
- limitied output torque:
