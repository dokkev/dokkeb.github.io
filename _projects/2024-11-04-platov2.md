This is a collaborative project between [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) and [Sony Group Corporation](https://www.sony.net/). 

## Introduction 
The Sony PLATO project at UT Austin focuses on developing remote telemanipulation interfaces and framkeworks to grasp and manipulate tools in the human enviroments. Using the [Maestro Hand Exokeleton](https://reneu.robotics.utexas.edu/maestro-hand-exoskeleton-0), we can estimate the joint angles of the human hand provide force feedback via bowden cables and series elastic actuators. We developed a 3 fingered robotic hand HT2205 motors, ESP32 microcontroller, SimpleFOC Mini, and CAN bus based on our [SocketCAN Motor Control](/motorcan/).

Due to time limit, we didn't implement PCB board, so we used wires to connect all electrical components. Detail design of the PLATO Hand will be posted in the future. We adopted collocated direct driven motor to achieve proximal actuation with high force transprancey and high bandwidth control. While MCP joints (A/A and F/E) are direct driven, PIP joint (F/E) includes a cable transmission with 1:1 ratio. One of the unique feature of the hand is that fingertip matierals are made of soft resin while the fingernail made of hard resin is connected to 6-dof miniature force-torque sensors.

The low-level hardware interface for the PLATO Hand was implemented using [`ros2_control`](https://control.ros.org/iron/index.html) which allows seamless integration of the hardware to ROS 2 framework.

  Teleoperation of PLATO Hand to Manipulate a Jenga Piece with Maestro Hand Exoskeleton
</div>

We made a first prototype of the PLATO hand with [Roboligent](https://roboligent.com/). Then we teleoperated the PLATO hand and Optimo arm with the Maestro Hand Exoskeleton and 3D SpaceMouse. As a conclusion, we verified our teleoperation pipeline, we found several problems to address:

- Limitied Torque Output: The HT2205 motor's rated torque according to the datasheet is 0.04 Nm which is enough to grab a light object such as a jenga block. However, it turns out that the actual torque output was much lower (about 10 times) than 0.04 Nm. 

- Overheating: Due to the motor's low rated torque, the motor pulled a lot of current to achieve the desired motion. This caused the motor to overheat and damaging the wires and some electrical compoenets glued to the base frame of the hand.

- Latency: With the SocketCAN and the USB-CAN Converter, we experienced a lot of latency in communication. Although the PLATO Hand is running on real-time kernel, USB is not supported in real-time because of its packed oriented nature. In addtion, since one ESP32 controls three motors, there may have been latency in motor control algorithm.

- Control : We only received the current motor position from the CAN bus, and the motor velocity was computed on the host computer. With the latnecy mentioned above, the velocity reading contaied a lot of noise leading to instability in impedance control. Therefore, we ended up implementing PD control loop inside the ESP32 embedded system.

- Range of Motion: Due to the collocated motor design, there's limited A/A (Yaw rotation) and thumb opposition (Roll rotation) range motion.

  Wiring of PLATO Hand
</div>

- Wiring: Each motor has a total of 9 wires (3 phases + 6 SPI (including power)) With 9 motors and 3 voltage converters, and 3 ESP32 stacks (ESP32 + CAN Transceiver + SimpleFOC Mini). There are a lot of wires packed inside the hand case making it to challenge to diagnose hardware issues. 


To address these problems, we have designed PLATO Hand V2 (PLATO2 Hand) with off-the-shelf quasi-direc drive actuator with on-board motor driver to increase
