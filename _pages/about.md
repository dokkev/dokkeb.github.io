My name is Dong Ho Kang (DK), and I am a PhD student investiages design and control of humanoid robots at [Human Centered Robotics Lab](https://sites.utexas.edu/hcrl/) in the University of Texas at Austin.

My research aims designing a contact/impact resilient force-transparent robotic hand and developing whole body controllers to achieve seamless motion for versatile whole body manipulation tasks for humanoid robots.
